                            plans.

                            multiple email addresses, identities, or devices in an attempt to circumvent the Official Rules, as
                            determined within Sponsor’s sole discretion. If you use fraudulent methods or otherwise attempt
                            to circumvent the Official Rules, your entry may be removed from eligibility at the sole discretion
                            of Sponsor. Sponsor has the right, in its sole discretion, to maintain the integrity of the
                            Sweepstakes, to void entries for any reason, including, but not limited to, the use of bots, macros
                            or scripts or other technical means for entering. In the event of a dispute regarding entries
                            received from multiple users having the same e-mail account, the authorized subscriber of the e-
                            mail account at the time of entry will be deemed to be the entrant and must comply with these
                            Official Rules. Authorized email account subscriber is the natural person who is assigned the e-
                            mail address by the Internet Service Provider (ISP), on-line service provider, or other organization
                            responsible for assigning e-mail addresses.
                            Random Drawing &amp; Odds of Winning: One (1) Grand Prize winner will be selected by
                            Administrator in a random drawing on or about August 3, 2020 from all eligible entries received
                            and combined throughout the Sweepstakes Period. Odds of winning a prize depend on the
                            number of the total eligible entries received and combined throughout the Sweepstakes Period.
                            Winner Notification: A potential winner will be notified by phone and/or e-mail and will be
                            required to confirm his/her name, address and phone number or email address, as the case may
                            be, within forty-eight (48) hours from when the phone call is made or email is sent, as the case
                            may be. If a potential winner does not confirm his/her contact information as requested within the
                            forty-eight (48) hour time period, then time permitting in Sponsor’s sole discretion, an alternate
                            potential winner may be selected in a random drawing from among all remaining eligible entries
                            received. If a potential winner cannot be reached directly within forty-eight (48) hours from when
                            the phone call is made or email is sent and/or does not meet the eligibility requirements, the
                            potential winner will be disqualified and, time permitting in Sponsor’s sole discretion, an alternate
                            potential winner may be selected in a random drawing from among all remaining eligible entries
                            received. The potential winner will be required to execute and return an affidavit of eligibility, a
                            liability release and, where lawful, a publicity release within five (5) days of date of issuance. If
                            such documents are not returned within the specified time period, a prize or prize notification is
                            returned as undeliverable, Sponsor is unable to contact a potential winner or a potential winner is
                            not in compliance with these Official Rules, prize will be forfeited and, at Sponsor’s sole
                            discretion, an alternate potential winner may be selected for the applicable prize from among the
                            remaining eligible entries received during the Sweepstakes Period.
